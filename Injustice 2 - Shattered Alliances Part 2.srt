1
00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:05.365
Superman’s behind bars.

2
00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:13.950
They couldn't see his good intentions were leading him down a path of tyranny

3
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.610
and evil.

4
00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:20.234
That’s how our greatest hero became our greatest threat.

5
00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:26.218
Shattered Alliances Part 2

6
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.605
Bruce, consider widening your circle of trust.

7
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.387
Nobody wins all by themselves.

8
00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:33.165
Not even you.

9
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.498
We need help, don't we?

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.349
Not his.

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.491
I’m not that guy anymore.

12
00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:41.774
Look, I get why you don't trust me.

13
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.861
But you should trust the Guardians.

14
00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:45.496
This ring means something.

15
00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:47.701
They put me through hell to get it back.

16
00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.663
Don’t worry, Bats.

17
00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:52.529
With this crew on the job, what could go wrong?

18
00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.817
What comes next, mere mortals cannot stop.

19
00:00:56.818 --> 00:00:58.765
We both knew it would come to this.

20
00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.929
Fate will not spare you.

21
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:04.089
You wish you had.

22
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.662
LIVE FREE

23
00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:09.291
OR DIE FIGHTING

24
00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:14.181
All day I've been reminded how I feel to be a hero.

25
00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:22.207
How many more innocent people die before you accept that some lives need to be taken?!

26
00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:25.571
The regime is making a comeback.

27
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:27.500
Not while I'm wearing this ring.

28
00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:38.477
(Wait… so I'm not dreaming?)

29
00:01:38.477 --> 00:01:40.294
This is my fight, Bruce!

30
00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:41.208
You need me!

31
00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:48.417
We both knew it would end this way.
