1
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.518
In my years fighting crime,

2
00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.085
I've learned one truth:

3
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.318
That every villain is the hero of his own story.

4
00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:17.580
Shattered Alliances Part 1

5
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.963
You're better than this, Clark.

6
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.018
That's the problem with fighting for truth and justice:

7
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.345
The battle never ends.

8
00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:30.399
When does it stop?

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.338
When there's no more crime.

10
00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:36.084
We're at war with these enemies.

11
00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:40.937
I won't hurt you unless I have to.

12
00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:46.199
Hope isn't enough to save the world.

13
00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.497
None of us wanted this.

14
00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:53.327
You are either with me or against me.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.411
We both knew it would come to this.

16
00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:58.779
It was only a matter of time.

17
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.083
I'll try to make it painless.

18
00:01:01.084 --> 00:01:02.708
THE REGIME

19
00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.181
WILL

20
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:05.447
RISE
