1
00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:12.622
It’s him.

2
00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:14.490
Who, Kara?

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.283
Who is it?

4
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:19.048
We need to get Kal.

5
00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:20.368
Now!

6
00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:23.433
Earth's defense’s irreversibly compromised.

7
00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:24.744
Begin the countdown.

8
00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:30.925
Holy…

9
00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:44.335
I am Brainiac

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.430
Shattered Alliances Part 5

11
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:53.213
I seek the one you called Superman.

12
00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:56.833
You have no idea what Brainiac can do.

13
00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:59.571
For years, I believed I have destroyed Krypton.

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.415
You're afraid of him.

15
00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:03.958
How do I beat him?

16
00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:04.555
You can't.

17
00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:09.574
Superman’s survival is an oversight I must correct.

18
00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:19.347
I collect worlds,

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.198
and then I discard the reminiscence.

20
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.329
NO REMORSE

21
00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:25.959
NO PRISONERS

22
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:27.920
NO SURVIVORS

23
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.269
I match your strength,

24
00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:31.843
you cannot match my intellect.

25
00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:34.497
Allow me to give you a proper demonstration.

26
00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:45.330
you have a plan?

27
00:01:45.737 --> 00:01:47.023
It's a work in progress.

28
00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:49.409
Earth’s time is up.
